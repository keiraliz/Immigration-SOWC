<br> <intro>
Inmigration is moving from one's native country to another. 
  <br> <br>
  A lot of the time when people have to flee the country to another they do so illegally. That's why now the term inmigration has such a bad rep socially. It is no more than people going from one place to another but due to the immense illegal inmigration that's been going on for so long in so many countries it has become the term of a social problem that almost every country faces. 
  <br> <br>
  There are a lot of reasons someone would want to immigrate elsewhere. The most common ones are war, educational purposes, poverty, because of natural disasters, unemployment, violation of human rights and many others.<intro>

<br><br><br>
    
    <a id="1"> <titulation> <div class="titulation"> War </div></titulation> 
<br> <ware> <div class="ware">
Due to the war between Russia and Ukraine there is an estimated of 6.6 millions refugees spread through Poland, Romania, Russia, Hungary, Moldova, Germany, Slovakia, Belarus and more neighbor countries, these being those that took from a few thousand to millions of immigrants from Ukraine. Most of them being mothers and childrens. The EU has granted Ukrainians the right to stay and work throughout its 27 member nations for up to three years. Refugees are housed in reception centers if they can't stay with friends or relatives. They are given food and medical care, information about onward travel and are entitled to social welfare payments and access to housing, medical treatment and schools.</ware></div>
<br><br><waree><div class="waree">
For some others the situation can be even worse. In some cases, immigrating because of war can lead to lack of access to food, health care, housing, and clean water and sanitation. They also face difficulties in renewing visas, the denial of civil rights and services, the fear of deportation, and anxiety about the future. Precarious living conditions are further heightened by unemployment.</waree></div>  </a>

  <div class="asimilation"> Assimilation</div>
  <br>
<div class="asimil">One reason why so many people are against immigrants, legal or ilegal is because they feel their culture and traditions are being threatened by them. </div>
 <br>  <br>
<div class="asimila">Assimilation is a way in which the process of integrating an ethno cultural, like immigrants, ethic groups, minorities and more, into a bigger or dominating culture, inside what is established common.</div>
<br> <br>

<center><img src="assimilationimage1.jfif"></center>
<br><br>
<div class='asimilat'>It causes rise to racism in societies for it means that people that immigrate to another country with hopes to be treated like a human with rights and respect, (the bare minimum) has to assimilate. They’ll have to leave behind their culture and tradition and sometimes even religion to take up those of the one’s around them.</div>
 <br> <br>
<div class='asimilati'>Of course, they’ll have to begin by the language. Immigrants have always been expected to learn their new country’s language if they hope to fit in. And, yes, one would expect them to learn the country's language someday but until then their rights, living conditions, and opportunities should not depend on that. Not to mention that depending on one's native language, some people still have an accent or a way of pronunciation that will always identify them like outsiders to be targeted.</div>

<a id="3"><Multiculturalism><div class="Multiculturalism">Multiculturalism</div></Multiculturalism>
<br><center><img src="multicul.png"></center><br>
<Multiculturalismtext><div class="Multiculturalismtext"> It's the way in which a society deals with the cultural diversity, both at the national and at the community level. Sociologically, Multiculturalism assumes that society as a whole benefits from increased diversity througuh the harmonious coexistence of different cultures. The view that cultures, races, and ethnicities, particullary those of minority groups, deserve special acknowledgement of their differences within a dominant political culture. </div></Multiculturalismtext></a>

  One of those we have that have already left their is: </div></powder><br><br>
  
<candidatetwin><div class="candidatetwin">Donald Trump</div></candidatetwin>
<center><img src="candidatetwinimage.jfif"><br></center>
<candidatetwintext> <div class="candidatetwintext">One of Trump’s main promises while campaigning was to build a beautiful wall that would keep any other than an American, a true American outside The Great America he was so sure he could achieve. It was started even though a lot of experts in the field, meaning not him, were concerned that the wall would be expensive, difficult to construct, ineffective in deterring illegal immigration, harmful to the border, offensive to personal poverty rights and a threat to the economic and social well being of the border communities. Of course, with the wall, the number of agents in border patrol increased drastically, which was not justified in the executive order. And the cost of the wall wasn’t either though we know that the millions that it cost would end up going to private detention companies.</div> </candidatetwintext>

<candidatetwo><div class="candidatetwo">Marie Le Pen</div></candidatetwo>
<center><img src="candidatetwoimage.jpg"><br></center>
<candidatetwotext><div class="candidatetwotext">The policies I represent are the policies represented by Mr Trump [and] Mr Putin”. <br><br> She’s been competing against Emmanuel Macron for a few years now for the position of President in France. This year she came close in behind him and lost by very little. Which is concerning, because as we already know she share’s ideologies with the exact men one would not want to share breath. One of Le Pen’s most know fact regarding politics is her view of islamShe has always been very vocal of her views about them. <br><br> In a 2017 interview, Le Pen “I’m opposed to wearing headscarves in public places. That’s not France. There’s something I just don’t understand: The people who come to France, why would they want to change France, to live in France the same way they lived back home?”
<br> <br>
 A multicultural society is a society that has multiple conflicts.”
  <br> <br> 
And there’s a lot more. But I don't think I need to say anything more for us to understand her views and beliefs. Which is “FRANCE how I want it to be, 100% french. Anything else would stain the country.”
